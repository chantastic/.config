# chantastic .config

I have [dotfiles](https://github.com/chantastic/dotfiles).  
But more and more of my apps use the [.config](https://github.com/chantastic/config) directory.

Symlinks always suck and I decided to stop keeping config in dotfiles.

# Ignorance is bliss

I'm intentionally ignoring known config directories.  
Choosing what I'd like to host is a balance.  
There are a number of secrets and tokens stored in this directory.  
And a deluge of tmp files.

So I'm blocklisting and adding back exactly what I need.
